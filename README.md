# Desert Walk

A game of solitare implemented in React Native and written in TypeScript.

## To Do

* Game over screen.
* Prettier cards.
* Spash screen.
* Make it possible to adjust the difficulty, that is the number of cards in each suit. It might be neat to start out with the easiest level. This means the app gets an intro screen.
* Test on different devices.
* Consider more data to the model objects, that is all observable properties and the sizes and positions of the elements.

* Keep track of the results for each game, that is: Number of moves, number of cards in correct spot, datetime the game started, datetime the game ended, difficulty.
